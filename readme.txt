Cygnus's CIT Pride Flag Totems is a resource pack designed for use with CIT Resewn or OptiFine, which adds custom models for renamed totems of undying.

Flag Names:
 - aroace
 - aromantic
 - asexual
 - bisexual
 - gay
 - intersex
 - lesbian
 - nonbinary
 - pansexual
 - progress
 - queer
 - transgender

This pack has been tested and is confirmed to be working on release 1.20.2 with CIT Resewn. It probably works fine down to version 1.13, and will very likely work on most future versions.
